# Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts  
### Hanlon's razor  
**Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor#:~:text=Hanlon's%20razor%20is%20an%20adage,unlikely%20explanations%20for%20human%20behavior.))  

> As useful as it can be, it is, however, important not to overthink this model. Hanlon's Razor is meant to help us perceive stupidity or error, and their inadvertent consequences. It says that of all possible motives behind an action, the ones that require the least amount of energy to execute (such as ignorance or laziness) are more likely to occur than one that require active malice.

I liked this summary of the model. It's not necessarily stupidity, but rather laziness, seeking the shortest path to completion, or lack of deep thought (e.g., when writing text replies such as emails or chat), that is often the reason why people do bad or stupid things. This model helps to understand this and can actually increase sympathy and understanding towards others.
