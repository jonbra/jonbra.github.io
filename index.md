I work as a researcher at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/). In addition I have a position as a Senior Lecturer at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/people/aca/jonbra/index.html) where I teach Bioinformatics and Developmental biology.

I am interested in a wide variety of topics including evolution and phylogenetics, bioinformatics, genomics and transcriptomics, eukaryote diversity and cell biology, and recently viral genomics.
