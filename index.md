I am a researcher at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/about/departments-and-centres/virology/jon-brate/) and former researcher and associate professor at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/people/aca/jonbra/index.html). I study the evolution and dispersal of microbes by using high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.
