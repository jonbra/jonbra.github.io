I work as a researcher at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/) in the Virology Department. In addition I have a position as a Senior Lecturer at the [https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/people/aca/jonbra/index.html](University of Oslo) where I teach Bioinformatics and Developmental biology. 

My research includes understanding the significance of non-coding RNAs in the evolution of multicellular animals. See for instance our work on [microRNAs in the unicellular ancestors of animals](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31063-7#%20), 
and on the [cellular development of _Sphaeroforma arctica_](/publications/01-2019-Sar_development/).

I also work on diversity and evolution of protists (single-celled eukaryotes) and we recently performed a [phylogenomic analyis of the green algal clade Dasycladales](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpy.13168)
