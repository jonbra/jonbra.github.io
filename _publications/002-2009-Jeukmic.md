<h3>Abstract</h3>
Two new classes Synchromophyceae and Picophagea, belonging to the heterokonts, have been proposed recently in separate studies of 18S rRNA phylogenies. Here we revise the 18S phylogeny of these classes by including all available sequenced species and applying Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods; *Synchroma grande* groups with the photophagotrophic *Chlamydomyxa labyrinthuloides* with high statistical support. This clade is sister to Chrysophyceae, together they share a common ancestry. Our results show that the creation of class Synchromophyceae by Horn et al. was premature, because they did not include data from the closely related *C. labyrinthuloides* and *Picophagus flagellatus* species. A revision of these classes should include additional species and most likely multigene phylogenies.
